<h3>Introduction to Coffee</h3>
<p>
    Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species.
    The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.
    Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, Indian subcontinent, and Africa.
    The two most commonly grown are arabica and robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. 
    Dried coffee seeds are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor.

<h3>Coffee and Society</h3>
<p>
    Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.
     It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte).
    It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative.

<h3>Coffee and Health</h3>
<p>
    Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults,
    with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases, although those
    long-term studies are generally of poor quality.
